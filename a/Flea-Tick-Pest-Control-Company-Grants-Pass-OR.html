<p>Kaolin particle films utilized in natural farming might control some pests, but can negatively affect natural enemies and cause other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might motivate natural enemy populations, however a higher variety of natural enemies does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have a negative impact on the environment.</p>

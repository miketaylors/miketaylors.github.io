<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is typically utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been efficiently used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>

It's possible that the repeated use of pesticides might be more harmful in the long term than the pests themselves. Preferably, these thresholds change for changes in market value, stage of crop development, cost of pesticides, etc., however in reality most are based upon repaired infestation or damage levels.</p>

A single spotting of any pest in a storage facility throughout an audit can mean a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your personal belongings with toxic chemicals, destroy the air quality in your house or business, possibly contaminate food and other perishables, and only kills pests at the surface area of the issue.</p>

<h3>Things to Remember When Dealing With Pest Control Holliston MA</h3>
<p>Although several sources specify IPM in various methods, previous models mostly focused on the environmental, and to some extent on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) identified an absence of a holistic IPM method that utilizes both traditional and modern tools.</p>
<p>Socio-psychological aspects including ethical and reasonable factors to consider were found to the chauffeurs in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that an absence of certified IPM experts and extension educators was an impediment for IPM implementation in developed countries.</p>

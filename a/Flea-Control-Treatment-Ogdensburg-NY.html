<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about reducing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management techniques are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is warranted.</p>

Insecticides toxic to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural opponents than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect types or life stages. </p>

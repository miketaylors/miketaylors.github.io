Chemical controls were to be used only after regular monitoring showed that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the expense of the control measures.</p>
<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so intolerable at times that the only choice left is to employ a local pest control company to get rid of pests. The specialist will typically spray pesticides around the border of different spaces if a professional pest control company is under agreement to an organization.

But due to the fact that these "sex" traps draw in primarily male insects, they aren't really reliable controls. This consists of mechanical, physical, cultural, chemical and biological control of pest. A routine monitoring program is the basis of IPM choice making, despite the control methods utilized.</p>

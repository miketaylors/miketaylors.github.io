<p>A wildlife control operator (WCO) is a professional trapper licensed by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to charge a cost for dealing with problem wildlife concerns. Termites eat furniture, documents, books, and even documents kept in lockers and safes, thus triggering colossal damage within just a few months. This stops the pest gaining resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer houses and organisations to check for insects or rodents. Classical biological control involves introducing natural enemies from a pest's native variety into a new area where native natural opponents do not offer control.</p>

This component handles the management element of the brand-new IPM model for information collection, company, and real actions against pest infestations.

<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be substantial barrier to the growth of your business. Nevertheless, some professionals translate IPM as turning chemicals from different mode of action groups to keep pest control effectiveness and reduce pesticide resistance with an emphasis on decreasing pest damage. Entomopathogenic nematodes can be used versus particular soil pests, germs, and infections against pests with chewing mouthparts such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, while fungi work versus a range of pests.</p>

<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the best for other organisms and for water, air, and soil quality; usage pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds instead of a whole area.

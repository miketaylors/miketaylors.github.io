Certain biostimulants based upon minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stressors, but are used as amendments with no claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ).

<p>Since the term IPM has actually been coopted by the chemical industry to mean essentially anything a practitioner desires it to indicate, Beyond Pesticides has actually welcomed the expression Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management better represents the focus practitioners need to have -emphasizing the broader ecology of pest management and avoiding poisonous chemicals unless there are no alternatives.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can only do so much to secure the food supply," states Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The truth is, food business operators need to take an active role in incorporated pest management by working closely with the specialists.</p>

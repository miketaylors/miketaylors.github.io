CHEMICAL CONTROL OF BUG PEST: Use of artificial chemicals for handling pest population is called chemical control and the chemicals utilized for this are called insecticides.</p>
<p>One ofthe most significant benefits of natural techniques is that they don't include the use of toxicchemicals.

However the exterminators not only help you in getting rid of the pests from your home, however they ensure the pests will not come again. IPM stresses using non-chemical control approaches, such as exclusion or trapping, before chemical choices.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and scheduled management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply picked biopesticides with low ecological effect. Professional exterminators use different types of pesticides and baits to kill and get rid of pests.

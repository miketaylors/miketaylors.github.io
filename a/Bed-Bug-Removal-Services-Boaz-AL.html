<p>Pesticides need to be registered by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) before they can be manufactured, supplied, offered or used in Australia. Rapidly verify the eligibility of a pesticide product for use in the LEED v4-certified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program. Nearly 10% of stream sites and 1.2% of ground water websites in agricultural locations, and 6.7% of stream and 4.8% of ground water site in metropolitan locations contained pesticides at concentrations going beyond benchmarks for human health originated from United States EPA standards and guidelines for drinking water.</p>

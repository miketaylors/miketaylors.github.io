An IPM scout can be the grower, a worker, a professional expert or pest control advisor. Integrated Pest Management, or IPM, is an environmental approach to pest management that combines a variety of chemical and non-chemical control methods in such a way that decreases danger to individuals and the environment.</p>
<p>There are several pest control companies located all over the city, that is why, is very important to know which one is the best in order to avoid being cheated by any mediocre company. Household pests can include insects such as cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes, or rodents like mice or rats. I have tried a number of pest control suppliers consisting of well recognized nationwide level brand names in the business, but have never stumbled upon anyone who reveals this degree of expert insight and approach.</p>

<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents.

Non-synthetic or natural pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall into this IPM group. Threat for animals - pesticides kill non-target (safe or helpful) types that habituate in the fields or orchards. These pests are just anywhere and all over, be it houses, offices, companies, dining locations, hotels etc, anywhere which is not truly kept properly and is not hygienic.</p>
<p>Kaolin particle films used in natural farming might control some pests, however can negatively impact natural enemies and trigger other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may motivate natural enemy populations, but a higher variety of natural enemies does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use fossil fuels and indirectly have an unfavorable impact on the environment.</p>

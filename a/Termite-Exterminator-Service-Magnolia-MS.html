<p>Although several sources define IPM in different ways, previous designs mostly focused on the environmental, and to some level on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ).

<p>Biological control methods can also be seen as natural solutions as they do not depend on the use of pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is needed due to the fact that rodents and insects carry diseases, infest your kitchen areas and bed rooms, and bite you or your pets. Use sign plants to determine the effectiveness of pest management techniques and to keep track of susceptible crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens necrotic spot infection (INSV) and tomato spotted wilt infection (TSWV).</p>

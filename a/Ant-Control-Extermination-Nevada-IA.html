<p>In addition to establishing clear signs that a pest control program is undoubtedly an IPM system, it is also required to offer criteria to determine efficiency of the system. Normally between thirty minutes to 2 hours is required to perform the basic pest control treatment. Public need is influenced by retail marketing techniques, concerns for food safety based on pesticide policies in their region, and an absence of understanding on food production to name a few aspects.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for soil, air, and water quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds rather of an entire area. Due to any variety of reasons, including those discussed in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural enemies typically enables potential pest organisms to experience practically uncontrolled population growth and allows them to reach pest status.</p>
<p>A biological control program can be successful if these suggestions are followed: 1) properly identify all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural opponents from a trusted biological control provider, 3) make certain there is a consistent supply of high quality natural enemies, 4) emphasize that appropriate shipping procedures be followed, and 5) obtain directions from biological control providers on correct release rates and timing of application.</p>

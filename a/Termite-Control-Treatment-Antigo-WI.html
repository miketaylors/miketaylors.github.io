<p>The principle of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for handling pests, has actually remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Cold storage is likewise considered a physical control and, although it does not necessarily kill the insect pests, it at least stops their development and more feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses a lot of the very same ideas as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>

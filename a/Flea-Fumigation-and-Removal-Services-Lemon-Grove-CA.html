The use of chemical agents to deal with either regular pest mitigation or more entrenched infestations ought to be left to expert pest management companies who are trained and certified in accordance with state regulations and health and safety requirements.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management suggests careful factor to consider of all available plant security methods and subsequent integration of proper measures that discourage the development of populations of harmful organisms and keep the use of plant security products and other types of intervention to levels that are financially and environmentally warranted and reduce or reduce dangers to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks or even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential component of an integrated pest management programme. But by focusing on non-chemical choices first, you can ensure that your pest management program is successfully eliminating pests at the least threat to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>

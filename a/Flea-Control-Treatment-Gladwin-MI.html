The Indian Pest Control Association (IPCA) is a non-profit trade association of professional pest management companies in India. Chemical control usually refers to the use of artificial chemical pesticides (Pimental 2009 ). However, to be technically precise, chemical control ought to consist of synthetic chemicals in addition to chemicals of microbial or botanical origin.</p>
<p>Select the least toxic (or lowest schedule) household pesticide offered. The majority of people usually think about pest control during the warmer months, when swarms of insects attempt to attack their homes and yards, however, pests understand no season.

<p>Typically, the main goal of IPM programs is on farming insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to incorporate illness, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management goals of websites such as commercial and residential structures, yard and turf locations, and home and community gardens.</p>

If a lot of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides must be utilized as the last hope, in principle, often they are the first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of specific endemic or intrusive pests and diseases or to protect the seed and transplants from common and relentless pest issues.</p>
